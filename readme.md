# LeapML Discord Bot

Hi! I'm Aleem -- this is a lil project for the Leap hackathon. It's like the midjourney bot, but since we use Leap it allows you to train your own models ðŸª„

<b>note:</b> this bot has now been updated, this is the old version. this one relies on the discord admin to provide a leap api, and all generations go through one account. the main branch contains a new version, where we store info in a database, and each user must input their own api key.
