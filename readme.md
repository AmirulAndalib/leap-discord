# LeapML Discord Bot

Hi! I'm Aleem -- this is a lil project for the Leap hackathon. It's like the midjourney bot, but since we use Leap it allows you to train your own models ðŸª„

<b>note:</b> this is a WIP, so if you have any feedback feel free to toss me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/aleemrehmtulla). still learning how to make bots, so there's a lot of room for improvement ðŸ™‚
